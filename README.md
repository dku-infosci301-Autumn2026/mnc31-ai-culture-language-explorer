# AI Culture & Language Explorer

> **Prototype status:** Dataset-exploration and evaluation-design prototype. This repository does not claim to comprehensively measure any AI model's cultural competence, determine what data trained a model, or represent Chinese culture as a single uniform perspective.

An interactive website for exploring how multilingual AI evaluation datasets represent culturally sensitive content in **English** and **Simplified Chinese**. The project presents matched benchmark questions, dataset annotations, and—where explicitly documented—precomputed model responses for comparison.

## Demo

The video below is the current project demonstration.

## Research questions

1. **Does AI understand culture equally across languages?**
   - How can English and Simplified Chinese versions of matched evaluation questions be explored side by side?
   - How are culturally sensitive (`CS`) and culturally agnostic (`CA`) questions represented in the selected datasets?

2. **When prompt language changes, does an AI response preserve cultural context?**
   - For a fixed, precomputed set of prompts, how do saved English and Chinese model responses compare with dataset-provided benchmark keys or reference material?

This prototype establishes a transparent foundation for later evaluation. It does not make general claims about all AI systems, all Chinese-speaking communities, or the contents of a model's private training corpus.

## Features

- Side-by-side exploration of English and Simplified Chinese Global-MMLU-Lite question pairs.
- Filters for subject, subject category, cultural-sensitivity label, and available culture/region/country annotations.
- Clear separation between:
  - source dataset metadata;
  - benchmark answer keys;
  - precomputed model outputs; and
  - project-authored descriptive comparison notes.
- A **precomputed response comparator**, rather than a live chatbot.
- A methodology page with provenance, limitations, sources, and licensing information.

## Data sources

| Source | Role in this project | Original source | Upstream license / status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Global-MMLU-Lite** | Matched English–Simplified Chinese multiple-choice question pairs and cultural-sensitivity metadata | [CohereLabs/Global-MMLU-Lite on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CohereForAI/Global-MMLU-Lite) | Apache License 2.0 |
| **CC-Eval** | Curated bilingual cultural-context/value-alignment examples, maintained separately from Global-MMLU-Lite records | [qiushi-dong/cc-eval on GitHub](https://github.com/qiushi-dong/cc-eval) | Follow the upstream repository's current license, notices, and citation instructions |

### Global-MMLU-Lite

Global-MMLU-Lite is a smaller member of the Global-MMLU dataset family. Its Hugging Face dataset card lists English (`en`) and Simplified Chinese (`zh`) configurations. The dataset contains multiple-choice fields including `sample_id`, `question`, `option_a` through `option_d`, and `answer`, plus cultural annotation fields including `required_knowledge`, `culture`, `region`, `country`, `cultural_sensitivity_label`, and `is_annotated`.

This project uses only the English and Simplified Chinese configurations. It matches equivalent records by shared `sample_id` values.

### CC-Eval

CC-Eval is a separate bilingual cultural-context source. It must not be merged with Global-MMLU-Lite as though both datasets have the same task format, labels, cultural definitions, or scoring rules.

Each CC-Eval-derived record exported for the website should preserve its original source file and record identifier when available. Before publishing a CC-Eval-derived subset, verify the upstream repository's current `LICENSE`, `README`, dataset-specific terms, and preferred citation.

## Website technology

The website uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that the implementation stays aligned with the technologies used in class. Python is used for dataset preparation and analysis. The site is intended to be deployed as a static website through Vercel. No Vite or React build framework is required.

## Data workflow

This repository stores small, website-ready, documented data exports—not an undocumented copy of every upstream dataset.

1. Download Global-MMLU-Lite locally through Hugging Face `datasets`.
2. Load only `en` and `zh`.
3. Match records using `sample_id`.
4. Preserve source metadata and cultural annotations in every derived pair.
5. Export a limited JSON subset for the static website.
6. Keep raw dataset downloads out of version control unless redistribution has been intentionally verified and is necessary.
7. Inspect CC-Eval locally; preserve its upstream record IDs and file paths when exporting a permitted subset.
8. Store precomputed model responses separately from source dataset records.

### Download Global-MMLU-Lite

Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install datasets pandas pyarrow
```

Load English and Simplified Chinese separately:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

english = load_dataset("CohereLabs/Global-MMLU-Lite", "en")
chinese = load_dataset("CohereLabs/Global-MMLU-Lite", "zh")
```

Use `sample_id` to match equivalent English and Chinese records. Do not interpret the `CS` label as evidence that every question concerns Chinese culture: cultural-sensitivity labels reflect the dataset's annotation process and may reference many cultures, regions, or countries.

## Precomputed response comparator

The comparator is **not** a live chatbot. A visitor selects a fixed dataset record and sees outputs saved from a documented model-evaluation run.

Each stored response should record:

- Exact model name and version/checkpoint.
- Model host or model-card URL, where applicable.
- Evaluation date.
- Prompt-template version.
- Decoding settings, especially temperature.
- Prompt language.
- Raw model output.
- Extracted answer, if the task is multiple choice.
- Dataset answer key or source-provided reference material, where applicable.
- A neutral, transparent comparison note.

For Global-MMLU-Lite, use terms such as **“matches the benchmark answer key”** and **“does not match the benchmark answer key.”** For open-ended CC-Eval examples, do not present output as universally right or wrong unless the source provides an applicable reference and the evaluation rubric is disclosed.

## Limitations

- This is an **evaluation-data prototype**, not evidence of the complete training data of any AI model.
- Differences between English and Chinese outputs may result from translation, prompt wording, tokenization, model design, subject difficulty, or benchmark construction—not only cultural representation in training data.
- Simplified Chinese is a language configuration, not a complete proxy for Chinese culture, nationality, identity, region, dialect, or lived experience.
- A cultural-sensitivity annotation is a dataset label, not an unquestionable cultural fact.
- The project measures only the selected model, version, prompts, settings, items, and evaluation date.
- A small prototype sample cannot support broad claims about AI systems generally.
